     (4.8, "It's good and clear that they introduce what models they use first in the markdown and then go into the code explanation."),
     (4.7, "It's great that they have consider the accuracy in different aspects as in false positie and false negative. This is something my team didn't think of. I also like the graph visualization they use."),

    [(4.5, "The Spotify idea is good and I like the way they appoarch it. They explain in detail on what they want to do. However, presentation sounds like reading off script which is less interactive."),
     (4.8, "The slides are really well made and the graphs are nice and clear. Might be too many words on each slides tho."),
     (4.7, "There are 6 models in total that they have tried! This is a lot and they explain each models one by one in detail and how they did it."),

     (4.5, "It'd be better to jump out from the slides and walk us through the code instead of having screenshots of code. But they still explain well."),
     (4.8, "I like that they notice what they are not doing so good on. Also there are many visualization to support what they are trying to talk about. Accuracy rate having 91% is high! Well donw!"),

     (4.5, "Talked about how they process the data to match what they want to do. They have visualization to support too. Have all the basic features they can do analysis on."),
     (4.7, "Talked in detail on what models are used and walk through the code in details."),
     (4.5, "I like the performance summary table. However, the way they present their work is to paste the code to the slides and the color of the code isn't that visible. Feels kinda rusty."),
